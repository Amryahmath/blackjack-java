- **Text-Based Interface**: Simple and intuitive console interaction.  
- **Standard Game Rules**: Includes features like hitting, standing, busting, and blackjack detection.  
- **Single or Multiple Decks**: Play with a configurable number of decks for more variety.  
- **Expandable Design**: Easily add new features, such as multiple players or a graphical user interface.

## 🎮 Rules of Blackjack  
- Each player is dealt two cards, and the dealer reveals one of their cards.  
- The goal is to get a hand value closer to **21** than the dealer without exceeding it.  
- Face cards (King, Queen, Jack) are worth **10** points, and Aces can be **1** or **11**.  
- On your turn, you can:  
  - **Hit**: Take another card.  
  - **Stand**: Keep your current hand and let the dealer play.  
- If your hand exceeds 21, you **bust** and lose the round.  

## 🛠️ Project Structure  
- `Card.java`: Represents individual playing cards.  
- `Deck.java`: Manages the deck of cards, including shuffling and dealing.  
- `Player.java`: Contains player-related logic, including their hand and actions.
